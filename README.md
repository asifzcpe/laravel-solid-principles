# Laravel SOLID Principles

## Overview

This Laravel project demonstrates the application of the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) in the context of payment gateways. LSP is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming and focuses on substitutability of derived classes for their base classes without affecting the program's correctness.

In this project, we explore how to implement various payment gateways while adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle.
